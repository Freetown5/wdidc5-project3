# Project 3

## Your mission:

Make something.

## It should include:

- Rails
- AJAX

## FAQs

- Can we work together?
  - You can certainly bounce ideas off each other and help each other out, but the final products should be individual.
- Are there any hard requirements?
  - No, except for the "it should include" above, and you can implement those as you wish. This is your chance to be really creative and create something that's completely **yours**. This should be considered a portfolio piece.
- I can't think of an idea!
  - To start off with, you might think of a problem you run into on a recurring basis, or a time you've found yourself thinking, "Man, I wish this existed," or, "Man, this is so inefficient." Necessity is the mother of invention. Many of the most popular apps and programs have been invented as a result of someone being ticked off by something that did or didn't exist. Feel free to ask your instructors for help!
- How will we be presenting these?
  - Science Fair-style on Thursday of Week 9, like Project 1.
