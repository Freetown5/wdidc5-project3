# Project 3

## Your mission:

Make something.

This is your chance to be really creative and create something that's completely **yours**. This should be considered a portfolio piece.

## Hard Requirements

- It must be a Rails app.
- It must incorporate AJAX. Bear in mind that doesn't *necessarily* mean using an external API.
- You must include at least 5 user stories.

## Checkpoints

#### Friday, Week 8

Submit a brief overview of your current idea, and 5 corresponding user stories.

#### Monday, Week 9

On Monday you will meet individually with an instructor to review your progress. Have something to show them.

#### Friday, Week 9

You will present your completed product. Presentations will be Science Fair-style, as with Project 1. 

## FAQs

- Can we work together?
  - The projects must be individual. However, you are more than welcome to seek help and inspiration from your classmates and instructors.
- I can't think of an idea!
  - To start off with, you might think of a problem you run into on a recurring basis, or a time you've found yourself thinking, "Man, I wish this existed," or, "Man, this is so inefficient." Necessity is the mother of invention. Many of the most popular apps and programs have been invented as a result of someone being ticked off by something that did or didn't exist. Feel free to ask your instructors for help!
